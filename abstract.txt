With the development of information technology, there are more and more data stored in the network, but the value of data to individuals is limited, only through the data sharing can the value of data be better  utilized. Due to the problems of private data leakage and single point of failure, centralized hosting of data sharing technology is very difficult to gain the trust of data owners. Therefore, a reliable distributed infrastructure is required to ensure the safe sharing of data. As a trusted decentralized database, blockchain technology has been widely used in more and more fields such as finance, supply chain, and medical care. A large volumes of valuable data are stored on the blockchain, and users can use the blockchain to share data securely. With the increase in the amount of data in the blockchain, the real-time search demand for data on the chain has gradually emerged, but the existing blockchian system does not support rapid retrieval of data. The main reason for this phenomonon is that the blockchain system did not take into account the rich query requirements in the initial design. The key value at the bottom of the blockchain only supports fast writing to the database and does not support fast retrieval. The low reading efficiency has become the bottlenect restricting the development of blockchain search functions.
