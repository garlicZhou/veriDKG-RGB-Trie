In terms of specific design content, in order to reduce the storage pressure on the chain, we innovativelt transform the storage mode of the blockchain from a single on-chain storage to a hybrid on- and off-chain storage mode, and we design a distributed semantic extraction algrithm which establishes the mapping relationship between on- and off-chain data.

Based on this hybrid storage structure, this paper designs an efficient query seheme for single-chain and cross-chain retrieval. In the single-chain retrieval part, in order to support rich query functions, we build a novel index structure called Merkle Semantic Tire. This structure combines the merkle tree, B+ tree and patricia tree to provide complex analytical query functions such as multi-keyword query, range query, and fuzzy query. In the cross-chain retrieval part, we first integrate the transaction formats on different chains into a unified RDF triple form to solve the challenge of the inconsistent format of heterogeneous chains. Then we extract the cross-chain committee from different chains and consititute a knowledge chain, and the nodes in the committee handle entity triples from different chains through cross-chain consensus to construct a cross-chain visualized global knowledge graph and provide cross-chain retrieval services. At the same time, we also provide the functions of proxy query and result verification for the light nodes in the blockchain. The light nodes need to connect to the full nodes to perform proxy queries and the full nodes need to provide verification proofs for the query results while returning the query results. So the light node can verify the query result locally.
